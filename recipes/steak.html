    <h1>Steak</h1>
    <p>Grill the perfect steak!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Steak</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>PIf your steak was marinating, wipe off the wet marinade with a paper towel, then set it down on the hot grill and leave it alone for several minutes without turning.
        </li>
        <li>After a few minutes, the meat will release its grip on the grill, and you can turn it without tearing the meat; If you start to turn it, and it's still gripping the grill, just give it another minute.</li>
        <li>Sear steaks over high, direct heat, then move them to indirect heat to finish cooking</li>
        <li>Once your steak is done to your liking, remove it to a plate and let it sit for at least 5 minutes before serving or slicing.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
